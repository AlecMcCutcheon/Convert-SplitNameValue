# Convert-SplitNameValue
Convert-SplitNameValue Is a Set of functions for Converting Data into a SplitNameValue String and vice versa. 

{ ConvertTo-SplitNameValue | ConvertFrom-SplitNameValue }

This Is Helpful for Pulling in Data from 1 or more Objects/Arrays and automatically setting that data to Labtech/Automate variables by using "Variable Set: Split NameValue Parameter". It could also be used to save Objects to a text file and pull them back out again and still be able to intract with the objects like normal, and It makes creating new objects easy.
